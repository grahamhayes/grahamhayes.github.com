Having taken a year or two hiatus on blogging, I have decided to give it
another shot.

A lot has happened since then, and recently I have started to do more and more
work in upstream OpenStack. Starting as a PTL I thought it might be useful to
have somewhere for me to rant, rave, and generally explain my (admittedly from
time to time bizarre) thought process.

I reckon there will be flurries of activity here, followed by silence, but we
shall see what happens in time :)
