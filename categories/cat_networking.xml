I have a few
services running at home, that I really don't want on the internet (OctoPrint etc), but I want to use
remotely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is as much documentation for future me as it is for anyone who stumbles across this page :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had previously set up a L2TP Remote user VPN in the UniFi controller, but it had a few issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roaming problems on mobile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Battery usage on mobile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slow Speeds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had heard of Wireguard a while ago (I think they had a stall near the OpenStack stall in FOSDEM
last year), but I had completely forgotten about them. It turns out some kind soul has created a
deb package to install WireGuard on Vyatta (which is what the USG is based on).&lt;/p&gt;
