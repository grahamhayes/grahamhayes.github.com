                <div>
<p>So, two weeks ago, I dropped a TC <a class="reference external" href="https://review.openstack.org/#/c/342366/">motion</a> and a mailing list <a class="reference external" href="http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-dev/2016-July/099285.html">post</a> and
waited for the other foot to drop.</p>
<p>I was pleasantly surprised - no one started shouting at me - but by trying
to not point fingers at individual teams I made the text too convoluted.</p>
<p>So, in an effort to clarify things, here is an overview of what has been said
so far, both in the mailing list and the gerrit review itself.</p>
<div class="section" id="feedback">
<h2>Feedback</h2>
<blockquote class="epigraph">
... does this also include plugins within projects, like storage
backends in cinder and hypervisor drivers in nova?</blockquote>
<p>No - this was not clear enough. This change is aimed at projects that are
points of significant cross project interaction. While, in the future there may
come a point where Nova Compute Drivers are developed out of tree (though
I doubt it), that is not happening today. As a result, there is no projects in
the list of <a class="reference external" href="https://governance.openstack.org/reference/projects/index.html">projects</a> that would need to integrate with Nova.</p>
<blockquote class="epigraph">
Could you please clarify: do you advocate for a generic plugin interface for
every project, or that each project should expose a plugin interface that
allows plugin to behave as in-tree components? Because the latter is what
happens with Tempest, and I see the former a bit complicated.</blockquote>
<p>For every project that has cross project interaction - tempest is a good
example.</p>
<p>For these projects, they should allow all projects in tree (like Nova,
Neutron, Cinder etc are today), or they should have a plugin interface
(like they currently do), but all projects <em>must</em> use it, and not use
parts of tempest that are not exposed in that interface.</p>
<p>This would mean that tempest would move the nova, neutron, etc tests to
use the plugin interface.</p>
<p>Now, that plugin could be kept in the tempest repo, and still maintained
by the QA team, but should use the same interface as the other plugins
that are not in that repository.</p>
<p>Of course, it is not just tempest - an incomplete list looks like:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Tempest</li>
<li>Devstack</li>
<li>Grende</li>
<li>Horizon</li>
<li>OpenStack Client</li>
<li>OpenStack SDK</li>
<li>Searchlight</li>
<li>Heat</li>
<li>Mistral</li>
<li>Celiometer</li>
<li>Rally</li>
<li>Documentation</li>
</ul>
<p>And I am sure I have missed some obvious ones. (if you see a project missing
let me know on the <a class="reference external" href="https://review.openstack.org/#/c/342366/">motion</a>)</p>
<blockquote class="epigraph">
I think I disagree here. The root cause is being addressed: external tests can
use the Tempest plugin interface, and use the API, which is being stabilized.
The fact that the Tempest API is partially unstable is a temporary things, due
to the origin of the project and the way the scope was redefined, but again
it's temporary.</blockquote>
<p>This seems to be the core of a lot of the disagreement - this is only temporary,
it will all be fixed in the future, and it should stay this way.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the discrepancy between projects is not temporary. The specific
problems I have highlighted in the thread for one of the projects is temporary,
but I beleive the only long-term solution is to remove the difference between
projects.</p>
<blockquote class="epigraph">
Before we start making lots of specific rules about how teams
coordinate, I would like to understand the problem those rules are meant
to solve, so thank you for providing that example.
...
It's not clear yet whether there needs to be a new policy to change the
existing intent, or if a discussion just hasn't happened, or if someone
simply needs to edit some code.</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately there is a big push back on editing code to help plugins from
some of the projects. Again, having the differing access between projects will
continue to exacerbate the problem.</p>
<blockquote class="epigraph">
<p>"Change the name of the resolution"</p>
<p class="attribution">—(Paraphrase from a few people)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That was done in the last patchset. I think the Level Playing Field title
bounced around my head from the other resolution that was titled Level Playing
Field. It may have been confusing alright.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="other-areas">
<h2>Other Areas</h2>
<p>I feel like I have been picking on tempest a little too much, it just captures
the current issues perfectly, and a large number of the community have some
knowledge of it, and how it works.</p>
<p>There is other areas across OpenStack the need attention as well:</p>
<div class="section" id="horizon">
<h3>Horizon</h3>
<p>Horizon privileged projects have access to much more panels than
plugins (service status, quotas, overviews etc).
Plugins have to rely on tarballs of horizon</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="openstack-client">
<h3>OpenStack Client</h3>
<p>OpenStack CLI privileged projects have access to more commands, as
plugins cannot hook in to them (e.g. quotas)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="grenade">
<h3>Grenade</h3>
<p>Plugins may or may not have tempest tests ran (I think that patch
merged), they have to use parts of tempest I was told explicitly
plugins should not use to get the tests to run at that point.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="docs">
<h3>Docs</h3>
<p>We can now add install guides and hook into the API Reference, and API
guides. This is great - and I am really happy about it. We still have
issues trying to integrate with other areas in docs, and most non docs
privileged projects end up with massive amounts of users docs in
docs.openstack.org/developer/&lt;project&gt; , which is not ideal.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="body">
                <div>
<p>I just proposed a review to <a class="reference external" href="https://review.openstack.org/342366">openstack/governance</a>  repo [0] that aims
to have everything across OpenStack be plugin based for all cross
project interaction, or allow all projects access to the same internal
APIs and I wanted to give a bit of background on my motivation, and how
it came about.</p>
<p>Coming from a smaller project, I can see issues for new projects,
smaller projects, and projects that may not be seen as "important".</p>
<p>As a smaller project trying to fit into cross project initiatives,
(and yes, make sure our software looks at least OK in the
Project Navigator) the process can be difficult.</p>
<p>A lot of projects / repositories have plugin interfaces, but also
have project integrations in tree, that do not follow the plugin
interface. This makes it difficult to see what a plugin can, and
should do.</p>
<p>When we moved to the big tent, we wanted as a community to move to
a flatter model, removing the old integrated status.</p>
<p>Unfortunately we still have areas when some projects are more equal -
there is a lingering set of projects who were integrated at the point
in time that we moved, and have preferential status.</p>
<p>A lot of the effects are hard to see, and are not insurmountable, but
do cause projects to re-invent the wheel.</p>
<p>For example, quotas - there is no way for a project that is not nova,
neutron, cinder to hook into the standard CLI, or UI for setting
quotas. They can be done as either extra commands
(openstack dns quota set --foo bar) or as custom panels, but not
the way other quotas get set.</p>
<p>Tempest plugins are another example. Approximately 30 of the 36
current plugins are using resources that are not supposed to be
used, and are an unstable interface. Projects in tree in tempest
are at a much better position, as any change to the internal
API will have to be fixed before the gate merges, but other
out of tree plugins are in a place where they can be broken at any
point.</p>
<p>None of this is meant to single out projects, or teams. A lot
of the projects that are in this situation have inordinate amounts of
work placed on them by the big-tent, and I can emphasize with why things
are this way. These were the examples that currently stick out
in my mind, and I think we have come to a point where we need to make
a change as a community.</p>
<p>By moving to a "plugins for all" model, these issues are reduced.
It undoubtedly will cause more, but it is closer to our goal
of Recognizing all our community is part of OpenStack, and
differentiate projects by tags.</p>
<p>This won't be a change that happens tomorrow, next week, or even next
cycle, but think as a goal, we should start moving in this direction
as soon as we can, and start building momentum.</p>

finished up the Newton design summit for OpenStack, and finished it a few days
later - please excuse any wierdness in syntax or flow :)</p>
<p>Austin was its usual weird, wacky, wonderful self. Everytime we are here, I
have a great time, I just can't deal with the heat :).</p>
<p>The summit format this year worked really well - I pretty much stayed in the
design summit hotel for the week - and got some very good work done.</p>
<div class="section" id="months-on-where-are-we">
<h2>6 Months On: Where are we</h2>
<p>One of the things I did before this design summit was to look at what we had
achived last cycle.</p>
<p>We had a quiet cycle overall, but we did merge some vital features.</p>
<p>Operators no longer need to use the awfull config format we created for pools
in Kilo, we now have a much easier to read YAML file that is loaded into the
database via the <code class="bash">designate-manage</code> cli, we now actually support multiple
pools in a real way with the addition of a schedular in
<code class="bash">designate-central</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="where-are-we-going">
<h2>Where are we going?</h2>
<p>So - the point of the design summit is to plan the future of the projects - and
designate is no execption. We were in a (very nice boardroom) room for a few
hours - and we talked through quite a few things.</p>
<img alt="https://photos.smugmug.com/Misc/i-p8SxMgH/0/X2/IMG_20160427_140741-X2.jpg" src="https://photos.smugmug.com/Misc/i-p8SxMgH/0/X2/IMG_20160427_140741-X2.jpg"><p>The collection of <a class="reference external" href="https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/newton-design-designate">etherpads</a> for the summit are available as well.</p>
<div class="section" id="golang-replacement-of-minidns">
<h3>Golang Replacement of MiniDNS</h3>
<p>One of the nicer things about our current architecture is the flexibility that
we have because we use the standard DNS protocols to update the target DNS
servers. This has the downside however, that we are writing code that deals with
DNS packets in python, which is slow. timsim from RackSpace has writen a POC
in go that has a very large perfomance improvement.</p>
<p>This needs to documented, and permission requested from the TC to move this
component to Go, (and will be a separate post in its own right).</p>
<p>After we got back it turned out that we were not the only project considering
this, and swift actually have a feature branch with code in place. So, based on
this, we are going to collaborate with them on the integration of Go to
OpenStack.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="worker-model">
<h3>Worker Model</h3>
<p>As we dicussed in Galway - we need to replace the current <code class="bash">*-manager</code> services
with a generic service that can scale out horizontally. As part of this we
planned out our upgrade and implementation plans for these services.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="docs-deprications-and-more-docs">
<h3>Docs, Deprications and more Docs</h3>
<p>Docs were a common theme - we were asked to improve them, and also have them
located in the main docs on the OpenStack.org website.</p>
<p>We had a member of the docs team in the room, who gave us some great guidenance
on how to include our docs in the correct place.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="vmt-the-application-process">
<h3>VMT - The application process</h3>
<p>On of the teams that supports OpenStack is the Vunrebility Management Team.
They deal with disclosures and assigning OSSA numbers to issues that could present
and issue to our deployers.</p>
<p>They had a session this summit on how that process might work, and designate
was one of the projects chosen to be used as a pilot as I have previously
produced Threat Analysis documentation for Designate inside of Hewlett Packard
Enterprise - this information is currently being processed for release to
the community.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="searchlight">
<h3>Searchlight</h3>
<p>Searchlight is a new (ish) project in OpenStack that enables true searching
capabilities on clouds. We have a designate plugin, but there are issues
with how we emit notifications from the v1 and the v2 API.</p>
<p>We decided that when we move the Horizon panels to v2, we will just listen for
v2 notifications in Searchlight.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="api-docs">
<h3>API Docs</h3>
<p>There was an interesting session on how the community are moving to document
their APIs. It will now reside in the projects repo, and is based on a
custom sphinx extention that was written for OpenStack.</p>
<p>As this progresses we will migrate designate to these docs, and remove our
current docs, as they are much harder to read.</p>

<p>We had <a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/designate/+bug/1552864">this bug</a> come
in yesterday.</p>
<p>It was a bit unexpected - as we tested it pretty extensively when it was being
developed.</p>
<p>The line in question was this:</p>
<pre class="code python"><a name="rest_code_c65485f2567941cc885a40b0501e2e0a-1"></a><span class="n">client</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">send</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">tcp_response</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre>
<p>In eventlet 0.17.x this behaved like the standard
<code class="python"><span class="n">socket</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">sendall</span><span class="p">()</span></code> , instead of <code class="python"><span class="n">socket</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">send</span><span class="p">()</span></code></p>
<p>(It was <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/eventlet/eventlet/commit/c315ee86dac996ac533b738f7c8777f4d01a0472">this commit</a> as it turns out - it was noted in the release notes <a class="reference external" href="http://eventlet.net/doc/changelog.html#id5">here</a> but we missed it)</p>
<p>The other major problem is that the bug did not manifest itself until we pushed
the AXFR over a long range connection.</p>

<h2>Designate Mid Cycle</h2>
<p>This was a little over a week ago, and I have been trying to get my thoughts down on
paper /  rst.</p>
<p>It was a good few days overall - we had our usual arguements about implementation of some
familiar features, we listed out reasons that our past selves were wrong about everything,
and how we should fix our mistakes.</p>

<h2>Kosmos Mid Cycle</h2>
<p>We sat down in Seattle last week to plan out how we were going to kick start
progess on Kosmos</p>
<p>(For those of you who don't know what Kosmos is - here is the overview <a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Kosmos">on the wiki</a> )</p>
<p>We decided on a few things, I managed to clarify my (admitedly weird and convaluted) thought process, and we started on the inital sets of patches.</p>
<p>It was a small group - some people were sick from the LBaaS / VPN / FW mid cycle the week before, but enough to start.</p>
<p>We covered the DB, the layout, and how we will interact with it. I showed our basic use of the olso_versionedobjects lib, and the basic pecan framework that was in place.</p>
<p>We have the basic design up on our specs repo <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/openstack/kosmos-specs">here</a> ( it is not publishing anywhere yet - I will fix that soon )</p>
<p>If anyone is interested in the project, give me a ping - be it for developing drivers, code, requirements or general interest. (But, really - if you want to write code, just jump in, or ping me for what the hot topics are)</p>
<p>In 2 weeks time I will be off the Designate Mid Cycle - a little closer to home this time - in Galway, Ireland.</p>

<p>So, yesterday Tim and Kiall +2'd the change.</p>
<p>It was quite a bit bigger than expected (+4444, -4230) so thanks to all the
reviewers who put time and effort into checking everything worked, and I hadn't
made any glaring mistakes :).</p>

<h2>The Big Rename</h2>
<p>So from tomorrow (2015-11-10) until Friday (2015-11-13) Designate will be frozen for new code.</p>
<p>I send an email to the openstack-dev list before the summit <a class="reference external" href="http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-dev/2015-October/077442.html">[2]</a> so, it shouldn't be a surprise (I hope)</p>
<p>So, why are we doing this?</p>
<p>When Designate started it had a v1 API, which used the term domains for DNS Domains. This was pre Keystone's Domain support, but unfortunately they also decided to use it. AS Designate was not even incubated at the time, there was not much we could do, but continue on.</p>
<p>When we started the v2 API, we decided to avoid confusion and expose "Domains" as "Zones".</p>
<p>This worked for a while, but as we worked on the V2 API, we had to write code to translate the internal code (which referenced Domains) to Zones. this caused code like:</p>

<p>which proved to be quite fragile. (Yes that last bit of code is trying to walk the error path of a JSONSchema Error and rename the path to the new terminology)</p>
<p>We are also logging messages about domains - which could prove to be quite confusing when we remove the v1 API and users are only interacting with zones.</p>
<p>So tomorrow morning-ish (UTC) we will start to rename every occurrence of "domain" in the code base to "zone" (without breaking Keystone domain support).</p>
<p>Anything that does not have the "the-big-rename" topic on Gerrit will be getting a procedural -2 from me or the designate-core team.</p>

<h2>Tokyo</h2>
<p>Oh, what a place. I thought I was ready for the experience, but this city has
to be visited to understand. From the 2 or 3 different metro systems that snake
across the city, to the 9 story electronics stores, it is something else.</p>
<p>Living in a city that has 3 metro lines that don't actually connect it was a nice
change to be able to get reliable public transport :).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="design-summit">
<h2>Design Summit</h2>
<p>This was a much more relaxed summit for Designate. We had done a huge amount of
work in Vancouver, and we were nailing down details and doing cross project work.</p>
<p>We got a few major features discussed, and laid out our priorities for the next cycle.</p>
<p>We decided on the following:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Nova / Neutron Integration</li>
<li>Pool Scheduler</li>
<li>Pool Configuration migration to database</li>
<li>IXFR (Incremental Zone Transfer)</li>
<li>ALIAS Record type (Allows for CNAME like records at the root of a DNS Zone)</li>
<li>DNSSEC (this may drag on for a cycle or two)</li>
</ol>
<div class="section" id="nova-neutron-integration">
<h3>Nova &amp; Neutron Integration</h3>
<p>This is progressing pretty well, and Miguel Lavalle has patches up for this. He,
Kiall Mac Innes and Carl Baldwin demoed this in a session on the Thursday. If
you are interested in the idea, it is definitely worth a watch <a class="reference external" href="http://https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZbiARM9FPM">here</a></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pool-scheduler">
<h3>Pool Scheduler</h3>
<p>A vital piece of the pools re architecture that needs to be finished out.
There is no great debate on what we need, and I have taken on the task of
finishing this out.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pool-configuration-migration-to-database">
<h3>Pool Configuration migration to database</h3>
<p>Are current configuration file format is quite complex, and moving it to an API
allows us to iterate on it much quicker, while reducing the complexity of the
config file. I recently had to write an ansible play to write out this file, and
it was not fun.</p>
<p>Kiall had a patch up, so we should be able to continue based on that.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ixfr">
<h3>IXFR</h3>
<p>There was quite a lot of discussion on how this will be implemented, both in the
work session, and the 1/2 day session on the Friday. Tim Simmons has stepped up,
to continue the work on this.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="alias">
<h3>ALIAS</h3>
<p>This is quite a sort after feature - but is quite complex to implement.
The DNS RFCs explicitly ban this behavior, so we have to work the solution
around them. Eric Larson has been doing quite a lot of work on this in Liberty,
and is going to continue in Mitaka.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dnssec">
<h3>DNSSEC</h3>
<p>This is a feature that we have been looking at for a while, but we started to plan
out our roadmap for it recently.</p>
<p>We (I) am allergic to storing private encryption keys in Designate, so we had a
good conversation with Barbican about implementing a signing endpoint that we would
post a hash to. This work is on me to now drive for Mitaka, so we can consume it in N.</p>
<p>There is some raw notes in the <a class="reference external" href="https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/mitaka-designate-summit-roadmap">etherpad</a> and I expect we will soon be seeing
specs building out of them.</p>

<p>Having taken a year or two hiatus on blogging, I have decided to give it
another shot.</p>
<p>A lot has happened since then, and recently I have started to do more and more
work in upstream OpenStack. Starting as a PTL I thought it might be useful to
have somewhere for me to rant, rave, and generally explain my (admittedly from
time to time bizarre) thought process.</p>
<p>I reckon there will be flurries of activity here, followed by silence, but we
shall see what happens in time :)</p>
