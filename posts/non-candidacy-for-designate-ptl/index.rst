**************************************
Non Candidacy for Designate PTL - Pike
**************************************

Happy new year!

As you may have guessed from the title, I have decided that the time has come to step aside as PTL
for the upcoming cycle. It is unfortunate, but my work has pivoted in a different direction over the last
year (containers all the way down man - but hey, I got part of my wish to write Golang, just not on the 
project I envisaged :) ). 

As a result, I have been trying to PTL out of hours for the last cycle and a half. Unfortunatly, this has had a
bad impact on this cycle, and I don't think we should repeat the pattern.

We have done some great work over the last year or so - Worker Model, the :python:`s/Domain/Zone` work, 
the new dashboard, being one of the first projects to have an external tempest plugin and getting lost in 
the west of Ireland in the aftermath of the flooding.

I can honestly say, I have enjoyed my entire time with this team, from our first meeting in Austin, back in 
the beginning of 2014, the whole way through to today. We have always been a small team, but when I think back
to what we have produced over the last few years, I am incredibly proud.

Change is healthy, and I have been in a leadership position in Designate longer than most, and no project should 
rely on a person or persons to continue to exist.

I will stick around on IRC, and still remain a member of the core review team, as a lot of the roadmap is still in 
the heads of myself and 2 or 3 others, but my main aim will be to document the roadmap in a single place, and not 
just in thousands of etherpads.

It has been a fun journey - I have gotten to work with some great people, see some amazing places, work on really
interestig problems and contribute to a project that was close to my heart.

This is not an easy thing to do, but I think the time is right for the project and me to let someone else make
their stamp on the project, and bring it to the next level.

Nominations close soon [0]_ so please start thinking about if you would like to run or not. If anyone has any questions
about the role, please drop me an email [1]_ or ping me [2]_ on `IRC`_ 

Thank you for this opportunity to serve the community for so long, it is not something I will forget.
