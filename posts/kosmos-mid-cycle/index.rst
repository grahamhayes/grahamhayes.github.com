*****************
Kosmos Mid Cycle
*****************

We sat down in Seattle last week to plan out how we were going to kick start
progess on Kosmos

(For those of you who don't know what Kosmos is - here is the overview `on the wiki`_ )

We decided on a few things, I managed to clarify my (admitedly weird and convaluted) thought process, and we started on the inital sets of patches.

It was a small group - some people were sick from the LBaaS / VPN / FW mid cycle the week before, but enough to start.

We covered the DB, the layout, and how we will interact with it. I showed our basic use of the olso_versionedobjects lib, and the basic pecan framework that was in place.

We have the basic design up on our specs repo `here`_ ( it is not publishing anywhere yet - I will fix that soon )

If anyone is interested in the project, give me a ping - be it for developing drivers, code, requirements or general interest. (But, really - if you want to write code, just jump in, or ping me for what the hot topics are)

In 2 weeks time I will be off the Designate Mid Cycle - a little closer to home this time - in Galway, Ireland.
